# HELP! How do I use this

Use these links to go to the code runner on trinket.

* Y9 Test 2: [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/python/7bd943b3b4ed?outputOnly=true)

Or, use this method if you want to use your own ide:
Click on the file you want (e.g. spelling-test-2.py)

Then, click the "copy raw file" button, which is next to the "Raw" button.

Finally, paste the code into whatever editor you want. I recommend trinket.
