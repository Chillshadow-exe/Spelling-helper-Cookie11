# HELP! How do I use this

To use this code, click on the file you want (e.g. spelling-test-2.py)

Then, click the "copy raw file" button, which is next to the "Raw" button.

Finally paste the code into whatever you want. I recomm]#end trinket.

To use Trinket, go to [trinket.io/python](https://trinket.io/python) and paste the code into the left side of the editor. Then, you can hit run to run the code.
